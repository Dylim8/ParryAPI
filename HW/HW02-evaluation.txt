Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.  Very complete answers!

On 5.2 you make a good case for component-based architecture for tic-tac-toe
but I wonder if that isn't a bit of overkill for such a simple application.
Perhaps a monolithic architecture would be sufficient?  Unless you are into
planning for a 4x4 or a 3D version extension...

On 5.6 likewise, the ClassyDraw application simply draws and stores, and the
operating system can be responsible for saving the resulting files.  You do
make a good case for a database, but I wonder what the tables look like?

On 5.8 you were supposed to DRAW the state diagram not DESCRIBE the state
diagram.  That's what the word "diagram" means ~ a drawing...  *grin*  Your
description seems correct though...

On 6.2 Hmmm.... same thing here... you need a diagram.

Otherwise, good job on this, you're doing well this semester overall, Dylan!

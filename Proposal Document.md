Description
  ParryAPI emerges as a cutting-edge solution designed to fortify online gaming communities against the pervasive issue of toxic communication. The project's essence is to develop a software API capable of analyzing and scoring the toxicity of user-generated content, effectively flagging hate speech, harassment, and other forms of negative interactions. Unlike existing programs that either offer limited scope or require extensive computational resources, ParryAPI is tailored for simplicity and accessibility, catering specifically to the needs of small-scale game developers and community moderators.

The core features of ParryAPI include:
  - Real-time sentiment analysis using the VADER model for immediate toxicity scoring.
  - Easy integration into existing chat systems via a simple API call structure.
  - Scalability to handle the diverse volume of community interactions.
  - A feedback system for continuous learning and accuracy improvement.
  - 
The software relies on Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for backend operations, while the frontend demonstration will be facilitated through a basic web interface, potentially built using frameworks like Flask or React. The required hardware specifications are minimal, making ParryAPI accessible for developers running even the most basic server setups.

Goals and Justification
  End-users of ParryAPI would be small to medium-sized gaming companies without the large-scale resources typically required for such advanced moderation tools. Post-launch, ParryAPI will be maintained through community feedback, regular updates, and potential cloud-based hosting solutions to ensure sustainability and performance. ParryAPI is the culmination of applying my education, and integrating the knowledge acquired across various subjects during my academic journey. It demands the utilization of programming skills, an understanding of natural language processing, and principles of software developmentâ€”all of which have been covered extensively in my coursework.
This project serves not just as an application of learned concepts but also as a bridge to extend beyond theoretical knowledge. It challenges me to translate classroom lessons into a tangible, market-ready product. The technical difficulty of ParryAPI strikes the delicate balance between being ambitious and achievable, ensuring it remains within the scope of a one-semester project. With access to the necessary tools such as Python, NLTK, and web development resources, coupled with the guidance of academic mentors, the project is well within my capabilities. Moreover, the project's focus on improving online social interactions aligns with my interests and is likely to resonate with peers and faculty who recognize the importance of healthy digital spaces. ParryAPI is not just a capstone for my academic endeavors but a socially responsible tool that paves the way for more inclusive gaming experiences. Its development and implementation embody the essence of practical learning and contribute meaningfully to the broader community, making it an exemplary project for this class.

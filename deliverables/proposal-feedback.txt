CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Dylan Lim
ParryAPI project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   Nice work on the document.  The description is at high enough level to
   give the reader an overview, and includes enough about the technology and
   the appication interface to let the reader know what this is about.

   The justification section is also well done, and states clearly why this
   is an important tool for the environment you address.  Anything that will
   potentially abate the amount of discontent in the world is a good idea,
   and you are to be commended!

Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides, although minimal, look great,
   your justification of both the project goals and the applicability to the
   course are well-thought-out and clear.  This is a very useful project!
   Your presentation skills were very professional.

   Good work overall.

your score:  5% out of 5% which is an A-plus

Great job on this presentation and proposal and great start to the semester!

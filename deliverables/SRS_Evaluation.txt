Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Excellent introduction, just the right amount of detail.  Nothing to
   add, nothing else needed.

-- Functional Requirements
   You really need more requirements here.  I realize that you are relying
   upon the tools to give you a determination about toxicity, but there
   needs to be more about how that will work.  What is the lexicon you will
   use?  Does that get fed into the tool?  Is the analysis of the tool done
   automatically?  Are there things you will 'tweak' or change about the
   tool's algorithm that make it different so that there are requirements
   you will need to specify for that?  How will the output appear to the
   user?  Will it be in a chat window or displayed on a web page?  Is that
   left up to the user of your API?  Can the user of your API modify any of
   the parameters that are used by your tool?

   I think you see what I mean.  For something this complex, there should be
   quite a bit more functionality specified than three requirements.

-- Performance Requirements
   The phrase "real-time analysis with minimal latency" can be summed up as
   "near-real-time analysis response time".  The phrase "real-time" has a
   specific meaning in terms of computing environments, and this ain't that.
   "Real-time" responses are understood to be on the order of milliseconds,
   and sometimes microseconds.  Real-time processing fails if not completed
   within a specified deadline relative to an event; deadlines must always
   be met, regardless of system load.  If you specify sentiment analysis
   response within two seconds, that's not real-time.

-- Environment Requirements
   This one requirement section needs a bit more explanation as to what you
   mean by "standard cloud platforms".  It needs more than just "AWS", which
   by the way you should spell out and THEN follow with the acronym at first
   use, like "...Amazon Web Services (AWS)..." ~ after that you can use the
   acronym by itself.  This goes for all acronyms you use in your document.

   Also, you specify the software you need for development, but you don't
   provide any idea of what kind of hardware is needed.  How much processor
   'horsepower' is required?  How much memory?  Do you use the graphics
   processor?  If so, which one or how much memory, or so on and so on...

=============================================================================
your score:  9% out of 10% which is an A-minus

All in all, not a bad first effort, you just need to fill in more specifics.

Make the changes as suggested above, including many more requirements for
the second submission and you'll get the full 10% on this document.

Software Development Plan Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- General Comments
   The document seems incomplete.  Several sections reference things which
   are not included or which will perhaps be included in later revisions.

-- Introduction Section
   This section is adequate, so you don't need to do more to it.

-- Architectural Design Section
   Section 6.2.2 needs more information at the architectural level to define
   how the major sections will communicate with each other.

   Section 6.2.3 needs to have diagrams of some kind [UML or otherwise] that
   describe the parts and their associations with each other; this should be
   different from 6.2.2 since it shows associations not data flow.

-- CSC and CSU Descriptions Section
   This is the "Detailed Design" section in which you should have diagrmas
   and descriptions of the details of each part.  Every part of the project
   should have its own separate paragraph, along with descriptions of any
   data structures used to transfer data between the parts.

-- Database Design Section
   This is essentially the same thing as the previous section, but strictly
   describing the database for the project, if any.  There should be an ER
   diagram [if the database is relational] or a document/graph description
   if those types of databases are used.

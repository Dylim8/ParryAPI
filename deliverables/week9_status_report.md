**Accomplishments**
  - Started making progress on the website
  - Researching options for hosting API and Website (AWS, Google Cloud, ngrok, heroku, swagger)
  - Created a form for others to share hate speech they believe should be added to the lexicon
  - Researching security options (serialization and publishing without releasing a public list of the hate speech) for release
  - Collecting unknown words (from the lexicon) for later use to add for more accurate scoring
  - Researching the GPT model as an option.

**Future Goals**
  - Make sure the locally hosted API and website can work together
  - Implement a larger dataset of hate speech using gaming slang in order to better score and identify hate speech
  - Start testing implementations and use cases

**Risks, Problems, and Concerns**
  - This is a sensitive topic for many, it won't be a conversation starter nor will it be a highlight. This generally 
makes it harder for me to talk to my peers about, especially when the hate speech dataset still needs to cover slurs
  - Even if the lexicon is completed, I need to research ways to protect the dataset of hate speech. As much as I
planned on having this be open source technology can be used to do more harm than good with the list.
  - Hopefully through serialization of the model where the lexicon and hate speech dataset can be imported directly
with the dataset not public.
  - There are still several different models for me to consider and test but this is an issue I can look at later

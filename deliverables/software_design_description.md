6.1 Introduction
ParryAPI is a sentiment analysis tool designed to identify and flag hate speech within online gaming communities. It leverages the Vader NLP model to analyze text in real-time, offering developers a means to maintain positive player interactions.

6.1.1 System Objectives
The primary goal is to equip smaller game developers with the capability to detect and respond to hate speech dynamically, enhancing online gaming environments.

6.1.2 Hardware, Software, and Human Interfaces
Software Interfaces: Flask framework for API management, NLTK with Vader for sentiment analysis.
Human Interfaces: Web interface for demonstrating ParryAPI capabilities and configuring sensitivity settings.
6.2 Architectural Design
ParryAPI's architecture incorporates the Vader model and Flask for core functionality, with future plans to include a database for managing training data.

6.2.1 Major Software Components
Sentiment Analysis Engine: Utilizes Vader and NLTK.
API Server: Built with Flask, handles requests and serves the analysis.
6.2.2 Major Software Interactions
Describes how the Flask app interacts with the sentiment analysis engine and potential external interfaces for data submission and configuration.

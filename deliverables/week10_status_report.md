**Accomplishments**
  - Feedback Collection: Successfully gathered input from participants at the Game Developers Conference (GDC), providing valuable insights into the project's direction and potential improvements.
  - Database Hosting Decision: Chose MongoDB as the hosting solution for the API, marking a significant step in establishing the backend infrastructure.
  - Initial Experimentation: Began exploring MongoDB, focusing on understanding its capabilities and how it can support the project's data management needs.
    
**Future Goals**
  - Expand the Dataset: In response to feedback emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive dataset, prioritize the collection and integration of a larger, more diverse sample. This may involve reaching out to communities for contributions, using public datasets, or partnering with organizations.
  - Accelerate Website Development: Address the slower progress on the website by allocating more resources, potentially seeking additional help or adjusting the project timeline to ensure the frontend meets the project's needs.
  - Integrate MongoDB: Continue the technical integration of MongoDB with the API, ensuring that data storage, retrieval, and management are optimized for performance and scalability.
  - Security and Privacy Measures: Given the sensitive nature of the data and the use of MongoDB, implement stringent security and privacy measures to protect user data and comply with relevant regulations.
    
**Risks, Problems, and Concerns**
  - Data Sourcing: Finding a larger and more diverse dataset for training the model presents challenges, especially regarding the ethical collection and use of sensitive data.
  - Technical Integration: Integrating MongoDB with the existing API and ensuring seamless data flow between the database and the website may encounter technical hurdles.
  - Community Engagement: The sensitive nature of the project makes community engagement and dataset contribution solicitation a delicate process, requiring careful communication and ethical considerations.
